"Design is the silent ambassador of your brand" - Paul Rand

Choosing a color palette and typography for your brand can be hard. When wireframing for my projects, I seek help from generative AI to brainstorm themes. Hence, the thought to build HueAI emerged. I also wanted to expand my skillset, so I combined learning with my interest in AI into this quick little project!
